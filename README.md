This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its mixture composition, utilizing both linear regression and random forest models. The dataset includes features such as cement, slag, water, coarse and fine aggregates, and the age of the mixture.

Objective: To accurately predict concrete strength and assess the impact of various mixture components on overall strength, assisting in optimizing construction material composition.

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest

Techniques: Model evaluation, R-squared analysis, hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search)
